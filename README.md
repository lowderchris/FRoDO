# FRoDO
Flux Rope Detection and Observation

## Goal
The goal of this project is the consolidation of various routines I've developed into a single coherent algorithm for public use and development. With that in mind, there are a few specific goals:
- Automated and consistent detection of magnetic flux rope structures
- Operation independent of dataset, such that the end user only needs to provide datacubes of magnetic field components and associated grids
- Tracking of detected flux ropes in time, outputting locations and associated statistics

## To-do
- [X] Create an initial README
- [ ] Create dataverse(?) repository for sample dataset
- [ ] Outline of overall algorithm structure
